"The Lilly Faculty Registry reports direct and indirect payments by Lilly, as well as Lilly’s portion of alliance partnership payments, to health care professionals serving as faculty members. When the ""Entity Paid"" is a company, hospital or university, and there is a different name listed as the service provider, it reflects an indirect payment which may or may not actually have been received in whole or in part by the listed service provider. Note: This report is designed to comply with Lilly’s Corporate Integrity Agreement reporting obligations. Due to differences in scope and definitions, the data reported in this report may differ from data included in reports submitted by Lilly for compliance with state payment reporting laws.","","","","","","","",""
